# Supervised Machine Learning Training

Jupyter notebooks created for a supervised machine learning training exercise, using an e-mail data set with some phishing examples.

Both examples use [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/).

## Example 01 - Feature Classification

**File:**
* 01 - ML - Feature Classification.ipynb

**Objective:**
* To automatically flag phishing messages using selected features (individual measurable properties) of an e-mail corpus.

## Example 02 - Text Classification (Natural Language Processing)

**File:**
* 02 - ML - Text Classification.ipynb

**Objective:**
* To automatically flag phishing messages using their content.

## Disclaimer

1. The notebooks' structure was based on [Jose Portilla](https://courses.pieriandata.com/bundles/zero-to-data-hero)'s 'Natural Language with Python' course.

2. The data set was created using a custom fork of Diego Ocampo's [Machine Learning Phishing](https://github.com/diegoocampoh/MachineLearningPhishing) project.
